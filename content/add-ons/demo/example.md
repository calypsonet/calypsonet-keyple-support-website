The Keyple project already hosts basic examples in [Java](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-java-example) and [C++](https://github.com/eclipse-keyple/keyple-cpp-example) showing how to implement Keyple components in a simple way.

To show how to use Keyple extensions that are not hosted by the project, CNA offers complementary [basic Java examples](https://github.com/calypsonet/keyple-cna-java-example) for Keyple extensions.
