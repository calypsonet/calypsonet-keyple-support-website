All Keypop and Keyple projects components are open source and hosted by the Eclipse Foundation.
In addition, CNA also offers a multitude of Keyple extensions, Keyple example applications and Keyple-based tools.
- Most of these supplements and tools are also published as open source.
- A few are restricted to CNA members.

Depending on the type of components, different software licenses are applied:
- For APIs, examples and demonstrators: so-called “permissive” licenses: use, implementation or modification of the component is totally free.
- For libraries: “copyleft” licenses: use and integration are free, but any modification of the component must be shared and returned to the community.
