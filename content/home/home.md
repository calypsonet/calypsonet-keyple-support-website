[Eclipse Keyple](https://keyple.org/) is a powerful open-source middleware for **integrating Calypso card processing into ticketing terminals**.
This technical support site provides:
- a [practical introduction](./basics/introduction/) to understanding and getting started with the Keyple solution.
- It also hosts some add-ons (open or closed) to the Keyple open-source project: [reader plugins](./add-ons/plugin-ext/), [demos](./add-ons/demo/) and support for declaring the [compliance of a Keyple-based terminal with ticketing terminal requirements](./basics/compliance/).

CNA also provides [Keyple-based tools](./add-ons/tool/) (some publicly accessible, some reserved for CNA members).
