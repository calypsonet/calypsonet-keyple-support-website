#### To enable ticketing applications to be portable independently of terminal solutions:

- **CNA** has standardized interfaces for the different software layers of a terminal: the ticketing terminal APIs.
- **CNA** has also published Java and C++ versions of these interfaces for ticketing terminals, hosted by the **Eclipse
  Keypop** open-source project. This code, licensed under the permissive MIT license, allows any solution to implement
  them without constraint.

#### To facilitate the implementation of ticketing terminals:

- **CNA** is also behind an open-source reference implementation of the ticketing terminal interfaces:  with the
  **Eclipse Keyple** project. This code is licensed under the **Eclipse Public License version 2.0**, it offers a high
  degree of flexibility for the design of ticketing terminals (open or closed) integrating these libraries.

The purpose of this technical support site is to offer advanced complements to the Eclipse APIs and projects sites:
demonstrators, reader plug-ins, examples of Keyple-based tools (some publicly accessible, some reserved for **CNA**
members).
