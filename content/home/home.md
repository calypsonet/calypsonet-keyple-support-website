[Eclipse Keyple](https://keyple.org/) is probably the **most powerful and complete open-source middleware for integrating Calypso card processing into ticketing terminals**.
This technical support site provides:
- a [practical introduction](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/keyple-support/introduction/) to understanding and getting started with the Keyple solution.
- It also hosts some add-ons (open or closed) to the Keyple open-source project: [reader plugins](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/keyple-support/reader-plugins/), [demos](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/keyple-support/ticketing-demo/) and support for declaring the [compliance of a Keyple-based terminal with ticketing terminal requirements](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/keyple-support/compliance/).

CNA also provides [Keyple-based tools](https://keyple-support.calypsonet.org/assistance-tools/overview/) (some publicly accessible, some reserved for CNA members).
