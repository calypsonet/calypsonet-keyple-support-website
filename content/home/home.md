#### Enable ticketing applications to be portable independently of terminal solutions:

- **CNA** has standardized interfaces for the different software layers of a terminal: the [ticketing terminal APIs](https://terminal-api.calypsonet.org/).
- **CNA** has also published Java and C++ versions of these interfaces for ticketing terminals, hosted by the [**Eclipse
  Keypop** open-source project](https://keypop.org/). This code, licensed under the permissive MIT license, allows any solution to implement
  them without constraint.

#### Facilitate the implementation of ticketing terminals:

- **CNA** is also behind an reference implementation of the ticketing terminal interfaces:  with the
  [**Eclipse Keyple** open-source project](https://keyple.org/). This code is licensed under the **Eclipse Public License version 2.0**, it offers a high
  degree of flexibility for the design of ticketing terminals (open or closed) integrating these libraries.

The technical support site offers advanced complements to the Eclipse APIs and projects sites:
demonstrators, reader plug-ins, examples of Keyple-based tools (some publicly accessible, some reserved for **CNA**
members).
