## Express your interest
Keyple is an open source middleware that can be integrated into a multitude of projects without any counterparty.
As we don't have direct knowledge of usage, it's difficult for us to measure the success of the solution's adoption without your testimonials. We'd like to ask you for 2 valuable pieces of feedback:
- add your logo to the table of [adopters of the solution](https://keyple.org/adopters-and-testimonials/)
- publish [your user feedback](https://keyple.org/adopters-and-testimonials/) on the project website

## Register your solutions and services
The project website allows users to publicly [reference their Keyple-based solutions and services](https://keyple.org/external-resources/).

For those wishing to publish in open source Keyple extensions without having to manage hosting, CNA can also provide dedicated repositories.
