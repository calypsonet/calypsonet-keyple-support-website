Keyple is an open source middleware that can be integrated into a multitude of projects without any counterparty.
As we don't have direct knowledge of usage, it's difficult for us to measure the success of the solution's adoption without your testimonials. We'd like to ask you for 2 valuable pieces of feedback:
- add your logo to the table of [adopters of the solution](https://keyple.org/adopters-and-testimonials/)
- publish [your user feedback](https://keyple.org/adopters-and-testimonials/) on the project website

The project website also allows you to publicly [register your Keyple-based solutions and services](https://keyple.org/external-resources/).
