[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Objectives for ticketing terminals Ensure interoperability between ticketing terminals and contactless cards\nCNA has specified a set of requirements for the different software layers of a ticketing terminal. Enable ticketing applications to be portable independently of terminal solutions\nCNA (the Calypso Networks Association) has standardized interfaces for the different software layers of a terminal: the ticketing terminal APIs. the open-source Eclipse Keypop project offers Java and C++ code translations of these interfaces for ticketing terminals . Facilitate the implementation of ticketing terminals\nThe open-source Eclipse Keyple project initiated by CNA is a first reference implementation of the ticketing terminal interfaces. Ticketing terminal requirements To ensure interoperability between ticketing terminal solutions and contactless card solutions, CNA has specified requirements addressing specifically the 3 different software layers of ticketing terminals:\nreader layer requirements solution layer requirements ticketing layer requirements (These 3 documents can be downloaded by registering on the CNA website.) Generally, interoperability problems between cards and terminals are often due to non-compliance with one of these requirements.\nMost of these terminal requirements are universal:\nThe reader layer requirements are generic and have no connection with the Calypso solution; they apply to any terminal solution operating smart card readers. For a ticketing system using a contactless solution other than Calypso, solution-specific requirements can be defined for the software layer specific to this solution (as for Calypso). The requirements for the ticketing layer target terminal applications according to specific ticketing use cases: they are not necessarily linked to the Calypso solution. Ticketing terminal APIs The ‘reader’ and ‘Calypso’ interfaces of the Ticketing Terminal APIs have been designed with a structure compatible with the terminal architecture on which the terminal requirements are based. So a solution implementing these APIs can meet the requirements of the reader and Calypso layers (responsibility for fulfilling the requirements of the ticketing layer lies with the applications).\nPortability of ticketing terminal applications Another advantage of standardizing terminal APIs is that it also brings portability of terminal applications independently of reader or Calypso middleware solutions.\nCertification of ticketing terminal solutions In the near future, for example, CNA plans to offer a certification service to check whether ticketing terminal solutions actually comply with terminal requirements for the reader and Calypso layers. The middleware to be certified will then have to be based on standardized ticketing terminal APIs in order to be verified by the certification tool.\nKeypop API Eclipse Keypop offers Java and C++ code conversions of the API definitions for ticketing terminals: these faithfully follow the interface definitions issued by CNA. These Java and C++ APIs are hosted by the Eclipse Foundation under the MIT open source license: a very permissive license that offers great flexibility to the middleware solutions implementing them (proprietary or open source). These interfaces guarantee the independence of the terminal applications using them, from the middleware solutions implementing them.\nEclipse Keyple is an initial reference implementation. Other projects have expressed interest in proposing alternative implementations of Keypop APIs. Keyple middleware Eclipse Keyple is an open source middleware solution implementing the Keypop APIs.\nOpenness Two implementations of Keyple are available in Java and C++, hosted by the Eclipse Foundation under the Eclipse Public License version 2.0. This license offers great flexibility to terminal solutions (proprietary or open source) using Keyple libraries. Keyple is a truly open project: it does not belong to one particular company, which can decide at any time to close the project for further development. The advantage of joining the Eclipse Foundation is that it guarantees that the solution respects intellectual property rights, and that the project’s governance is open. Anyone in the open source community can contribute, the project is driven by its contributors.\nScalability In addition to implementing the terminal APIs in compliance with the terminal’s requirements, the Keyple solution also provides extension capabilities:\nPlugin APIs can be used to interface any smart card reader hardware solution. Distributed APIs can be used to design distributed architectures for remote control of smartcard readers, regardless of communication mode. Completeness \u0026amp; maintenability The 2 main strengths of the Keyple solution:\nThe Keyple Calypso module is probably the most complete Calypso middleware on the market: it supports all card transaction features.

The use of this interface is independent of the Keyple solution. The Reader API categorizes the smartcard readers into 2 types:\n“simple” card readers, which only manage “synchronously” the card application selection, “observable” card readers, which also support “asynchronous” card application selection. In general, all “contactless” reader solutions are observable, because for these readers the smartcard is always removable: it is necessarily necessary to notify applications of card insertion or removal events from the reader’s RF field. On the other hand, for some “contact” reader solutions, card presence is statically defined: these readers don’t need to be observed.\nProperties of a smartcard reader solution through the Keyple Service API For a Keyple-based terminal, smartcard reader solutions are interfaced using reader plug-ins. Keyple’s Service API enables ticketing terminal applications to access “locally” 3 categories of reader solutions:\na “simple” plugin enables only static configuration of smartcard readers → the most common case in embedded systems. an “observable” plugin enables the management of reader solutions that can be hot-plugged or hot-disconnected. → mainly 2 uses: readers connected over serial links (e.g. USB), or mobile solutions with an energy-saving mode (reader power supply cut off at standby). a “pool” plugin for interfacing with solutions offering dynamic allocation of reader resources according to the need. → this is how an HSM-type solution works. Integrating a smartcard reader solution into Keyple through the Plugin API For a Keyple-based terminal, a dedicated plug-in for any smart card reader solution must implement Keyple’s Plugin API:\nSPIs are differentiated in particular for the 2 reader types and the 3 plug-in categories. other features are linked to the native API capabilities of reader solutions: autonomy to manage the Select Application command autonomous synchronous, autonomous asynchronous or non-autonomous card insertion detection, detection of card withdrawal at the end of a transaction, managed autonomously (synchronous or asynchronous) or non-autonomous, ability to detect card removal during a card transaction The Keyple project offers a guide for developing plugins to integrate smartcard reader solutions.\nAdditional ‘Reader Plugins’ provided by CNA The Keyple project already hosts several plugins for interfacing with “standard” smartcard reader solutions (PC/SC, Android NFC / OMAPI), or for emulating readers.\nTo illustrate some other ways of designing plugins, CNA has also released additional plugins under the Eclipse Public License version 2:\nFor some of these plugins, the native libraries of the reader solutions are public, in this case, the plugin can be compiled autonomously. In the opposite case, a mock is used to compensate the unavailability of the native reader library, meaning that it is necessary to contact the manufacturer in order to compile the plugin. 4 plugins are designed for integration into Android based embedded ticketing terminals equipped with a contactless card reader, as well as one or more contact readers for SAMs.\nThe Famoco plugin interfaces only with SAM readers, as the contactless reader on the Famoco supported terminals is based on the standard Android NFC API (natively supported by Keyple). In addition to SAM readers, the Coppernic, Flowbird and Bluebird plug-ins manage an observable contactless reader (capable of detecting the card presence). The 5th plugin enables a Calypso legacy HSM to be interfaced on a Linux server equipped with a Spirtech HSM.\nName Supported Device Native reader library accessibility Interface OS Language Coppernic C-One v2 public Internal Android Kotlin Famoco FX100, FX105, FX200, FX205, FX300, FX915, FX920 public Flowbird Axio Touch Validator/MTBorne validator, Magnetic Axio Touch Validator, Axio 4 Validator, Infigo Driver Console, Voyager Embedded Ticketing Vending Machine, Coppernic C-One, Coppernic C-One V2, Zebra TC77, ACTIA PSDT private Bluebird EF501, EF551 private Legacy HSM Spirtech HSM private IP Linux Java Some special features:\nThe embedded Android terminals addressed by these plugins only support static configurations for their contactless card and contact SAM readers. However, the Coppernic and Famoco plugins are designed as “observable” plugins, because when these portable terminals are in standby mode, their readers are no longer powered (as if they were unplugged). Most of these readers for embedded terminals are “configurable” to enable the support of specific communications protocols. In addition, the Bluebird plugin can be configured to support the Enhanced Contactless Polling (ECP) protocol specific to Apple NFC devices.
